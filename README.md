# Emile
Utility for painless blogging with Zola.

---

<b>Emile</b> is a little script I wrote in shell script (bash) to make my life easier while blogging with Zola. I thought more people could benefit from it, so I polished it up and put it on Github. Feel free to use it, modify, redistribute under GNU General Public License terms. I hope it makes your bloggnig life easier (and that you apprecate the pun).

## Config file
Emile uses a config file in your home directory called <i>.emilerc</i>.
This config file follows the TOML standard and at the moment contains the following info:
- all the blogs you registered for use with Emile
- your favourite editor (otherwise it falls back in the one defined in your environment in $EDITOR)
- your timezone of choice (otherwise it fallsback on the one defined in your environment in $TZ) 

## Register a blog
You can register a blog under a label for easy access through the following command:

`emile set blogs <label> <posts_dir>`

You want the posts_dir to be the directory where your posts live, in your Zola blog.

E.g.
`emile set nightcup ~/code/blog/cotent/posts`

## Write a blog post
You can write a new blog post in two ways:

- by referring to a registered blog:
`emile new <label> "Post title" [-t tag1,tag2] [-c Category] [-e none|/editor]`
- by specifying the path where the blog post should be created:
`emile new -d <posts_dir> "Post title" [-t tag1,tag2] [-c Category] [-e none|/editor]`

E.g.
`emile new nightcup "New Post" -t blogging,casual -c "Casual Posts"`
`emile new -d ~/code/blog/content/posts/ "New Post" -t blogging,casual -c "Casual Posts"`

The new blogpost will be created following those steps:
- A new folder will be created with the slugified title of the post as name.
e.g. if the post name was "New Post", the folder will be named "new-post"
- Inside the newly created post, emile will create an index.md containing a minimal header containig title, date, draft and taxonomies (tags and categories)
- if you didnÂ´t use `-e none`, emile will try to open the post with your favourite text editor (either defined in .emilerc, in $EDITOR or if you passed it as a parameter via `-e`)

## Set your favourite editor
Emile allows the creation of some config variables.
You can set your favourite editor using the command `set` as follows:
`emile set config editor /path/to/editor`

The chosen editor will be saved in the config file .emilerc residing in your home.
When you set your favourite editor, emile will use it to open your posts when you create one.

## Set your timezone
The config file .emilerc also allows you to set your timezone. If not set, it will try to figure it out itself with the $TZ environment variable. If none of those options are set, it will fallback to UTC.

To set your timezone with emile, run the following command (locale needs to follow IANA timezone convention):
`emile set config locale Europe\London`

## Show configuration
You can print the content of your configuration living in .emilerc with the following command:
`emile conf`

## Diagnose configuration problems
Sometimes it can happen that modifying manually your configuration some stuff might get messed up... for this reason I created a command called `doctor` which tries to diagnose what's wrong with your configuration. You can diagnose your configuration with the following command:
`emile doctor`

## New features / Feedback
That's all for the moment, but there will probably be more features coming down the line, according to other needs I might have for my blogging. In case you are using emile for your blog, thank you and feel free to send me any suggestions or requests for new features.

Happy blogging!
